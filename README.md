# Scraping Sports Stats
This is a series of Python codes that fetchs HTML tables containing sports stats (Team averages, opponent averages and advanced stats if applicable), converting numeric values to float, displaying those stats in a DataFrame and its descriptive statistics.
For now, Major American Sports are in offseason (NFL is an exception, but is not a target right now), so the only code available is EuroLeague Basketball.
